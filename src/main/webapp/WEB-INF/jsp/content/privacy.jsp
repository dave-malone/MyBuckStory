<p>The Company will use a good faith effort to make it clear why the

purposes.</p>
<p>From time to time, the Company or a partner may sponsor a

collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will
apply.</p>

by applicable law; (2) to enforce the terms of use and Agreement or to
protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety of members of the

after those changes have been posted. If, however, we are going to use
Members’ personally identifiable information in a manner materially
