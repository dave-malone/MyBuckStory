their own personal use, provided that no copyrighted or patented
MyBuckStory Material or Material is downloaded. Illegal and/or

your Material to anyone else in addition to the Company), fully-paid and
royalty-free (meaning that the Company is not required to pay You for
the use on the Services of the Material that You post), sub-licensable
(so that the Company is able to use its affiliates and subcontractors
such as Internet content delivery networks to provide the Services), and
worldwide (because the Internet and the Services are global in reach).

distribute your Material outside of the Services and Website. <br>

<p>You agree to grant the Company the right to a perpetual,
world-wide, royalty free, irrevocable license to your Material to use,
copy, sell for profit, modify, publish, edit, translate, transmit,

streaming, podcasting, online/broadcast and suggested lists), to publish
your Material in connection with the Service, Website and any
affiliates, to publish your Material elsewhere within the Company or any
Company website through links to the Company, and to sublicense such
rights, all without any obligation to You, whether by way of
compensation, attribution or otherwise. Such license shall apply with
respect to any form, media, or technology now known or hereafter
developed. The Services contain Material of other Members. Except for
Material posted by You, You may not copy, modify, translate, publish,
broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, or sell any other Member’s
Material or MyBuckStory Material appearing on or through the Services or
Website without written approval from the Company or the Member. <br>

<p>You represent and warrant that: (i) You own the Material posted
by you on or through the Services or otherwise have the right to grant

Material on or through the Services does not violate the privacy rights,
publicity rights, copyright, contract rights or any other rights of any
person. You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies
owing any person by reason of any Material posted by you to or through
the Services <br>

connection with viewing the Website and using the Services. <br>

of any person or Member. The Company assumes no responsibility for
monitoring the Services or Website for inappropriate Material or
conduct. If at any time the Company chooses, in its sole discretion, to
monitor the Services or Website, the Company nonetheless assumes no
responsibility for the Material, and no responsibility for the conduct
of the Members submitting any such Material. <br>
